                                    <h3>Contextualizing your Connections to the Built Environment: My Minnesota Community Spaces and Architectural Heritage</h3>
                                    <p>

The built environment of our communities shapes our lives in both subtle and profound ways, utilizing architecture to create spaces that can be experienced by an entire community where they can gather, form memories and history unfolds. In my home of Minnesota, this relationship between architecture and community life is particularly evident - from local recreational facilities to towering urban landmarks. The built environment of a community not only helps foster a greater sense for those that utilize the space(s) but also makes the communities what they are, they stand both figuratively and literally as pillars of the community. As a child and even to the current day, my built environment has acted as a second home, places where I could go to if I ever needed to get away, could spend my free time, hang out with friends, places that made me who I am today. Among the countless architectural sites in Minnesota, the Guidant John Rose Oval, Minnesota State Capitol, St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel, Highland Water Tower, IDS Center and Schoenecker Center stand as some of the most important architectural sites in my built environment and have been highlights of Minnesotan architectural heritage. 
<br>
From my previous built environment essay, the Guidant John Rose Oval was under construction from June to December 1993. Being from the late twentieth century, it stands as an example of the American Modernist style. “The Oval,” as it is referred to by myself and other Roseville hockey natives, exemplifies the American Modernist idea of function over form as was common among American Modernist public architecture of the twentieth century. The Oval is asymmetrical and features many large and open spaces, which foster a sense of community and collaboration as the spaces are often used for public events. The oval’s architecture also features flat roofs and less than minimal decoration and ornamentation, which was common for other architectural sites of this style. The oval is almost entirely constructed with concrete, with some sections being built with painted brick, as the indoor rink calls for certain conditions to insulate the arena, concrete is a cheap and effective option. The back of the site, which faces the outside rink, is concrete and brick as well, however, this side has many large windows to view the rink and let light into conference/meeting/event rooms, once again exemplifying the American Modernist style. The origins of the Oval were first in the works in 1983 as the governor of the time eagerly wanted to host the Olympic Games, and after years of local efforts, Roseville was chosen by the task force created by the governor to determine the best place for the rink to be placed. Soon after, the city received state funding to begin designing and constructing a multipurpose outdoor skating complex. The name came from a beloved Roseville teacher, John Rose, who was also in the Minnesotan House of Representatives. In 2004, cooling system leaks caused the complex to shut down for the season, but a donation of $500,000 from the Guidant Foundation in June of 2005 allowed for the necessary repairs, and as a result, “Guidant” was added to the complex’s name to show appreciation. Since its opening, the Oval has hosted 
<br>
numerous events, such as the Bandy World Championships for both men and women, the US Speedskating Championships, as well as Minnesota Wild public practices, and even their original jersey reveal. The Oval represents the intersection of functional design and community gathering space, while its architectural style might not command immediate attention, its significance lies in its innovative approach to multi-use design and seasonal adaptability, as the facilities allow for winter and summer uses. Featuring both indoor and outdoor spaces that adapt to community needs throughout the year in the forms of hockey rinks and a skate park. This flexibility of the built environment is unique when I look at other examples that I have seen in class, but it also reflects a similar key theme in American architectural development - the creation of spaces that serve multiple functions while fostering community connection.

The Minnesota State Capitol was built from 1896-1905 and created by Cass Gilbert, who studied at MIT – whose architectural program was based on the Ecole de Beaux method. This style was dominant in American architecture in the late 1800s to mid-1900s, specifically with civic buildings. This structure first piqued my interest for a very simple reason – the dome.  Domes are one of my favorite architectural features, and the Minnesota Capitol has a fantastic dome, which, even before taking this course, I could tell took inspiration from the dome at St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City. This structure reflected the American Renaissance of the time, drawing inspiration from classical and European works – such as St. Peter’s Basilica. The use of Georgia marble and Minnesota granite displays both local pride as well as the nation’s growth in industrial capabilities. The capitol was built during industrial and urbanization growth in Minnesota, being symbolic of the State itself as well as its location looking over St. Paul with its
<br>
monumental scale plus classic design, it stands as a reminder of our government and Minnesotan pride. The base of the dome also features a sculpture of a gilded quadriga, “The Progress of the State.” This piece was commissioned by Gilbert and made by Daniel Chester French, who also did work such as the Lincoln Memorial and Edward Clark Potter. The sculpture depicts a chariot being pulled by four horses (representing the elements) and two women (representing agriculture and industry), with one man riding the chariot (representing Minnesota), symbolizing the forward progress of Minnesota – driven by agriculture and industry. This statue not only further represents Minnesotan advancement but also the American ‘prosperity’ of the Gilded Age (further reinforced with other ornamentation of the capitol).

The St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel, designed by Emmanuel Masqueray and constructed from 1916-1919, is representative of an early twentieth-century interpretation of religious architecture in Minnesota. Masqueray, who also designed the St. Paul Cathedral and Basilica of St. Mary in Minneapolis, brought his experience in European architectural training to the Midwest, creating a structure that utilizes a Romanesque Revival style. This work shows the influence of French Romanesque churches such as the Basilique Saint-Sernin de Toulouse in France. The church is constructed of mostly brick but also features some limestone and recently had its flooring replaced with Kasota limestone – which is a hallmark of University of St. Thomas architecture – and what I like most about the church is the marvelous stained windows. Every day I walk to class through North campus, I always make sure to track my path so that I can walk by the stained-glass windows whose artisanal prowess never fails to amaze me. The chapel's design emphasizes community gathering, though in a more formal when compared to 
<br>
other non-religious spaces given the spiritual context. Its construction during Minnesota’s rapid growth period for Catholic institutions reflects the city's ambition to create significant institutional architecture that would serve generations. Sitting atop a hill, the St. Thomas Aquinas Chapel is symbolic of religious and academic aspirations and representative of how European architectural traditions were adapted for an American context.

The Highland Water Tower in Highland Park, Minnesota, was constructed in 1927-1928 and designed by Clarence Wigington, who was America's first African American municipal architect. The tower demonstrates how utilitarian structures, such as a water tower, can transcend their basic function and design to become something more, for example (and in this case) architectural landmarks. My first time seeing the tower was not in this class but during my childhood when I would go to Highland Arena for hockey camps, practices, and games. I had no idea that it was a water tower, I just knew it as ‘the cool tower that meant I needed to turn to get to Highland Arena.’ I did not even know that you could get up into the tower. Even still, I always had an interest in the structure as my lack of knowledge manifested into the curiosity of what it was and what it was used for, questions I had forgotten about until this course revitalized and finally answered them. Wigington's tower combines practical infrastructure with aesthetic appeal as well as additional functionality, creating an architectural structure that serves both as a water tower and as an observation point - offering views of a higher vantage point since the tower stands at around 134 feet tall. The tower is made up of concrete and brick and is reminiscent of Italian Renaissance towers such as the Palazzo Vecchio Tower in Florence, where you can see it may have taken influence in terms of construction material, shape, and utilizing an observation 
<br>
deck, but it also innovated the design to fit the context, shifting from a medieval defensive design to a more decorative/ornamental design reflecting the Progressive Era belief of beautifying public infrastructure. This structure not only showed how European architecture can be repurposed to fit a new context, but Wigingon also made great strides for minority representation in America and the architectural world. The tower's design reflects the era's interest in revivalist styles while serving an essential public function, combining utility with community service.

The IDS Center, built from 1972-1974 and designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, stands as Minneapolis's defining modern structure, constructed of reflective glass, steel, and aluminum. It first caught my eye when my brother and I were driving around the Twin Cities looking for places to play PokemonGo, when we saw the towering figure of IDS Center, he suggested we go inside and check it out, both for the in-game rewards as well as the building/architecture itself. We were pleasantly surprised to see how the skyway system allowed us to not only cover more ground for our game but also allowed us to travel between buildings without having to deal with the Minnesota weather of falling snow and slippery ice/slush that just is not fun to walk around in when you are not wearing the proper footwear. Since then, when driving by the glass tower anchoring the downtown skyline, I think back to that time. Johnson and Burgee's design exemplifies the late International Modernist’s ability to combine commercial architecture with public gathering spaces utilizing clean lines, flat roofs, large windows, modern materials, and open space, something I learned in class that I never thought of before was how they maximized the number of corners for the structure, allowing for more corner offices (which I have only heard everyone that has an office loves to have). The building's open first floor has 
<br>
seven stories, known as the Crystal Court, which serves as a community space that connects neighboring buildings via skyways and acts as retail space for shopping and originally had a small movie theatre. IDS Center is symbolic of the Twin Cities’ emergence as a major corporate center and exemplifies American innovations in design, public transport, and utilization of public spaces. 

Schoenecker Center was built from 2022-2024 and was designed by RAMSA and BWBR Architects, sitting on Summit Ave. at the South campus of the University of St. Thomas. This building was first introduced to me during my freshman year when I had the pleasure of watching the building get constructed in real-time, which was especially exciting to me as I am a STEM major and hoped to have future courses in the new building (I sadly have not had a course classroom be there, yet). Once the building opened, I conducted a self-tour and thoroughly enjoyed seeing the new open classrooms, utilities like individual bathrooms - even including complimentary tampons/pads, and a walkway lined with chairs and desks, which I use to complete homework or hang out before/after class as well as a collaborative space for classmates, utilizing the whiteboard left there for students. Schoenecker also has the eSports room, which was exciting to me, being a member of the eSports club and on multiple eSports teams.  The style is that of contemporary academic architecture of institutional modernism but keeping to the University of St. Thomas roots of gothic design, blending the two to achieve a design similar to other architecture on campus and also utilizing sustainable design practices. Schoenecker Center is constructed of Kasota limestone, a popular material used in campus architecture (as noted above), as well as large glass windows. The sustainable design was not in 
<br>
vain, as the Schoenecker Center received the gold LEED award, the most notable green building rating system, highlighting Minnesota and American architecture as a whole’s shift toward more sustainable practices while maintaining and even improving design, technology, and utilities.

From the community-focused design of the John Rose Oval to the strides in modern development and implementation of sustainable design of the Schoenecker Center, Minnesota's architectural heritage reflects broader themes in American architecture - the emphasis on community spaces, adaptation to climate, technological and sustainable innovation, and the balance between function and form. These buildings, each serving different purposes and representing different communities and eras, share a common thread in their contribution to community life and their reflection of American architectural evolution. My connection to these architectural spaces offers a lens through which to view Minnesota and America’s architectural heritage, reminding us that our built environment becomes meaningful not just through their design but through the lives lived and memories created within their walls. This journey through Minnesota's architectural landscape demonstrates how American architecture continually adapts to the context to serve the community while creating spaces that shape our collective experience and personal histories.
